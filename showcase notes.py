Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced showcase,
I offered a solution.
Splitting up.
But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.
They called me a madman.
And what I predicted came to pass.
Congratulations, you're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to separate 2nd period.
-----------------------------------
Have you ever seen a kid try to lie?
That's what students look like when they try to wing showcase.
You know about tupules. Me.
You know about lists. Me.
But I never taught you to wing it.
That's why you're so BAD AT IT.
-----------------------------------
Dread it, run from it. Showcase always arrives.
-----------------------------------
Showcase is inevitable.
-----------------------------------
I respect you, student. When I'm done, half of your grade will still be alive.
I hope it remembers you.
-----------------------------------
You couldn't live with all the late work, and where did it lead you? Back to Wiebe.
